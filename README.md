# Dockerized Maven-CI-CD Workflow for Java Projects
This project provides a streamlined CI/CD pipeline for Java applications. By combining Maven with Docker and Jenkins, the workflow automates building, testing, packaging, and deploying applications â€” ensuring faster delivery and consistent quality.


## Key-Highlights
- **Automated Build**: Compile Java code with Maven, generate a JAR file, build a Docker image, and store successful artifacts..

- **Quality Assurance**: Run automated tests to validate functionality, with test reports stored for debugging and QA tracking.

- **Containerized Delivery**: Push Docker images to a container registry for easy access and deployment.

- **Continuous Integration**: Use GitHub webhooks to trigger the pipeline whenever code changes are pushed.
  
- **One-Click Deployment**: Deliver applications directly to the target environment without manual effort.

## Workflow Stages 

### This project consists of the following Stages:
### 1. Build
- **Purpose**: The ```Build``` phase handles compiling the Java source code with Maven, generating a JAR file, and creating a Docker image for the application. It also saves the produced artifacts for later reference.
- **Benefits**: Ensures the code is consistently packaged and always available in a deployable Docker image.

### 2. Test
- **Purpose**: The ```Test``` phase runs automated checks to validate functionality and quality. Test outputs are stored for review and troubleshooting.
- **Outcome**: Confirms the application is reliable, bug-free, and aligned with quality standards.

### 3. Push
- **Purpose**: The ```Push``` phase publishes the built Docker image to a container registry such as Docker Hub, making it accessible for others.
- **Benefits**: Enables easy sharing and distribution of the application in container form.

### 4. Deploy
- **Purpose**: The ```Deploy``` phase delivers the Dockerized Java application to the designated environment, making it available to users.
- **Outcome**: Provides a smooth, repeatable, and efficient deployment with minimal manual steps.

## Requirements 
Before setting up the workflow, ensure you have:

- A Linux server (Ubuntu recommended) with Jenkins installed.

- A Docker Hub account (for pushing built images).

- Basic knowledge of Jenkins pipeline configuration.
