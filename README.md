# Dockerized Maven-CI-CD Workflow for Java Projects
This project provides a streamlined CI/CD pipeline for Java applications. By combining Maven with Docker and Jenkins, the workflow automates building, testing, packaging, and deploying applications — ensuring faster delivery and consistent quality.


## Key-Highlights
- **Automated Build**: Compile Java code with Maven, generate a JAR file, build a Docker image, and store successful artifacts..

- **Quality Assurance**: Run automated tests to validate functionality, with test reports stored for debugging and QA tracking.

- **Containerized Delivery**: Push Docker images to a container registry for easy access and deployment.

- **Continuous Integration**: Use GitHub webhooks to trigger the pipeline whenever code changes are pushed.
  
- **One-Click Deployment**: Deliver applications directly to the target environment without manual effort.

## Workflow Stages 

### This project consists of the following Stages:
### 1. Build
- **Purpose**: The ```Build``` phase handles compiling the Java source code with Maven, generating a JAR file, and creating a Docker image for the application. It also saves the produced artifacts for later reference.
- **Benefits**: Ensures the code is consistently packaged and always available in a deployable Docker image.

### 2. Test
- **Purpose**: The ```Test``` phase runs automated checks to validate functionality and quality. Test outputs are stored for review and troubleshooting.
- **Outcome**: Confirms the application is reliable, bug-free, and aligned with quality standards.

### 3. Push
- **Purpose**: The ```Push``` phase publishes the built Docker image to a container registry such as Docker Hub, making it accessible for others.
- **Benefits**: Enables easy sharing and distribution of the application in container form.

### 4. Deploy
- **Purpose**: The ```Deploy``` phase delivers the Dockerized Java application to the designated environment, making it available to users.
- **Outcome**: Provides a smooth, repeatable, and efficient deployment with minimal manual steps.

## Requirements 
Before setting up the workflow, ensure you have:

- A Linux server (Ubuntu recommended) with Jenkins installed.

- A Docker Hub account (for pushing built images).

- Basic knowledge of Jenkins pipeline configuration.

## Handling
To get started with the CI/CD pipeline for our Java application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this Repository**: Clone this repository to your local development environment.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MugasatiSrimeghana/Dockerized-Maven-CI-CD-Workflow-for-Java-Projects.git
   ```
2. **Configuration**: Customize the pipeline configuration to match your project's specific requirements. Adjust pipeline files, scripts, and environment variables as needed.

3. **Commit Your Code**: Add your Java application's source code to this repository, making sure it's organized in accordance with your project's structure.

4. **Set Up Pipeline Triggers**: Configure GitHub webhooks to automatically trigger the pipeline with every code push, ensuring seamless integration and deployment.

## Limitations

1. **Scaling Issues** : Works fine for small apps, but builds/tests get slow as project size and dependencies grow.

2. **Security Risks** : Credentials in Jenkins and public Docker images can expose vulnerabilities if not managed right.

3. **No Rollback Strategy** : If deployment fails, you’re fucked unless you manually redeploy an older image.

4. **Limited Testing** : Only basic unit/integration tests; no performance, security, or static code analysis unless you add extra tools.

5. **Single Point of Failure** : If Jenkins server crashes, the whole pipeline is dead until it’s fixed.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Scalable Deployments (Kubernetes/Helm)** : Move from single-server Docker deployment to Kubernetes with Helm charts.
Gives rolling updates, auto-scaling, and proper rollback support.

2. **Advanced Testing Integration** : Add SonarQube for static code analysis, JaCoCo for coverage, JMeter for performance tests.
Makes sure no buggy or insecure code slips through.

3. **Security & Compliance** : Integrate vulnerability scanning (Trivy, Anchore) before pushing Docker images.
Store secrets safely with Jenkins credentials plugin or HashiCorp Vault.
