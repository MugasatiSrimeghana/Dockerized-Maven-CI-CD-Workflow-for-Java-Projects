## Key-Highlights
- **Automated Build**: Compile Java code with Maven, generate a JAR file, build a Docker image, and store successful artifacts..

- **Quality Assurance**: Run automated tests to validate functionality, with test reports stored for debugging and QA tracking.

- **Containerized Delivery**: Push Docker images to a container registry for easy access and deployment.

- **Continuous Integration**: Use GitHub webhooks to trigger the pipeline whenever code changes are pushed.
  
- **One-Click Deployment**: Deliver applications directly to the target environment without manual effort.

## Requirements 
Before setting up the workflow, ensure you have:

- A Linux server (Ubuntu recommended) with Jenkins installed.

- A Docker Hub account (for pushing built images).

- Basic knowledge of Jenkins pipeline configuration.

## Workflow Stages 

### This project consists of the following Stages:
### 1. Build
- **Purpose**: The ```Build``` stage automates the compilation of our Java code, creating a JAR file with Maven. It builds a Docker image for our application and archives successful artifacts for reference.
- **Benefits**: Streamline development, ensuring that our code is deployable and readily accessible in a Docker image.

### 2. Test
- **Purpose**: The ```Test``` stage is responsible for comprehensive code testing to guarantee correctness and quality. Test results are stored for review and analysis, allowing us to maintain high code quality.
- **Outcome**: Ensure that our application is free from defects and meets our quality standards.

### 3. Push
- **Purpose**: The ```Push``` stage simplifies sharing our Docker image. It uploads the Docker image to a Docker repository, making it easily accessible to our team or end-users.
- **Benefits**: Facilitate distribution and sharing of our application in Docker form.

### 4. Deploy
- **Purpose**: The ```Deploy``` stage automates the deployment of our Java application to a designated machine, ensuring accessibility for end-users.
- **Outcome**: Achieve a reliable and efficient deployment process with minimal manual intervention.
